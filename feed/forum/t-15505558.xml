						 <p>Just looked at the test page, looks much improved. It's currently lacking the big &quot;Welcome to this Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th Edition wiki&quot; thing at the top, I assume that's unintentional?</p> <p>If I had to make a change to the current test page lineage section, I'd add an extra line break before both &quot;Setting Specific&quot; and &quot;Custom&quot; (and maybe UA as well, for consistency) to set them more apart. It'd set them more apart, and we have the space for it. But, overall, super nice work. This is much better than the current home page.</p> <p>EDIT: Oh, and you're missing Spelljammer under setting specific! And I suppose dragonlance as well, since the Kender page is now up?</p>

						 <p>Take a look at the test page, let me know what you think, I reset it back to 3 columns and moved the Setting Specific, Custom, &amp; Unearthed Arcana to the same column as the Monstrous.</p> <p>As for the wrong icon for the races&#8230; yeah, that wasn't intentional lol. It should be fixed now.</p>

						 <blockquote> <p>I don't understand how to get to the basic races from the home page.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the homepage, scroll down or click &quot;races&quot; to go to the lineage section. From there, click &quot;Common&quot; to go to a list of common lineages, which includes Human, Elf, and Dwarf.</p> <p>On that note, it's a bit odd that the race/lineage section on the homepage uses the artificer's gears icon instead of the &quot;people&quot; icon that the race section used before, and still uses at the top of the page. Is that intentional, Fredbob? Seems a bit of an odd choice to me.</p>

						 <p>I don't understand how to get to the basic races from the home page. When I click &quot;Races&quot; none of the links in that section lead to entries about basic Dwarf, Elf, Human, etc. It's all just custom lineages.</p> <p>I was able to find the Dwarf page (for example) via Google search, but as best I can tell you can't get there from the home page.</p>

						 <blockquote> <p>Unless there are objections to the widening of the content space on the main page</p> </blockquote> <p>Was just about to bring that up, actually. Changing the entire width of the front page for this seems a bit odd. With the length of the Exotic column, I think it'd be easy to fit Setting Specific, Custom, and UA under Monstrous. That way, I'm pretty sure the width would be the same as the current homepage, and the length wouldn't get any longer since Exotic is already longer than those categories combined.</p> <p>Thanks again for your help with this, Fredbob.</p>

						 <p>I moved 'Custom' to just above 'Unearthed Arcana', that does look better, thanks for the suggestion.</p> <p>I tried the table concept, and it just doesn't really fit on the main page. Mainly because the simple table (using the '||' to create the table) has no way of removing the lines between rows. Since we don't have those anywhere else on the main page it looks kind of out of place. Our only other option would be advanced tables (essentially html). And while I can do that, it'd take a little while and make maintaining those lists a harder because it's a lot more code and making sure you've got all the opening and closing tags lined up. Especially since we keep things alphabetical and so we insert in the middle of lists sometimes.</p> <p>Unless there are objections to the widening of the content space on the main page. I think what we have on that test page is what we'll go with on the main page.</p>

						 <p>Looks awesome! I second moving Custom to the end of the third column though as well, even just as 'Custom Lineage'. Other than that, that is beautiful!</p> <p>EDIT: Another option instead of widening the page to do four columns, is to lengthen it going down the page, similarly to what was there before but originally in two columns &#8212; something like below or even doing the left &quot;column&quot; going down like this and the right column with the way it is?</p> <p>Common</p> <table class="wiki-content-table"> <tr> <td>Dragonborn</td> <td>Dwarf</td> <td>Elf</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Gnome</td> <td>Half-Elf</td> <td>Halfling</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Half-Orc</td> <td>Human</td> <td>Tiefling</td> </tr> </table> <p>Exotic</p> <table class="wiki-content-table"> <tr> <td>cell-content</td> <td>cell-content</td> <td>cell-content</td> <td>cell-content</td> </tr> <tr> <td>cell-content</td> <td>cell-content</td> <td>cell-content</td> <td>cell-content</td> </tr> <tr> <td>cell-content</td> <td>cell-content</td> <td>cell-content</td> <td>cell-content</td> </tr> <tr> <td>cell-content</td> <td>cell-content</td> <td>cell-content</td> <td>cell-content</td> </tr> <tr> <td>cell-content</td> <td>cell-content</td> <td>cell-content</td> <td>cell-content</td> </tr> <tr> <td>cell-content</td> <td>cell-content</td> <td>cell-content</td> <td>cell-content</td> </tr> <tr> <td>cell-content</td> <td>cell-content</td> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> </table> <p>Monstrous</p> <table class="wiki-content-table"> <tr> <td>cell-content</td> <td>cell-content</td> <td>cell-content</td> </tr> <tr> <td>cell-content</td> <td>cell-content</td> <td>cell-content</td> </tr> <tr> <td>cell-content</td> <td>cell-content</td> <td>cell-content</td> </tr> <tr> <td>cell-content</td> <td>cell-content</td> <td></td> </tr> </table> <p>Setting Specific</p> <table class="wiki-content-table"> <tr> <td>cell-content</td> <td>cell-content</td> <td>cell-content</td> </tr> <tr> <td>cell-content</td> <td>cell-content</td> <td></td> </tr> </table> <p>Custom Lineage<br /> Unearthed Arcana</p>

						 <p>Looks great! Personally, I'd move the &quot;Custom&quot; link to the very end instead of the very start, as right now it kind of looks like it says &quot;Custom Common&quot; or something, but apart from that, it's much better!</p>

						 <p>Sorry for slow reply &#8212; there isn't any sort of notification system about these forums or a link to jump here so I had to Google to get back here lol</p> <p>Yes, it had been a while since I checked the Aasimar page - at the time of my last checking, it was missing its base level information (age, alignment, etc) for its uppermost section; and only had the new revised information. If that has been fixed, I haven't checked lately and I apologize for that.</p> <p>I suppose I can kind of see where you're coming from with the race list getting expansive, but I guess I'm just a weird one that prefers one page that has links instead of having to click into two or three pages to get where I want to go. Same with if the Backgrounds and Feats section get collapsed into page hops too. I don't think there's really a way to compromise between the two, honestly, unless you have a way to expand the content container of the main page to be wider so you could have more columns across and shorter column lists.</p> <p>About the only compromise type of edit that I can think of is to list just the Standard lineages and the Monstrous races; and then have page redirects for the setting-specific lineages or something &#8212; that way at least the most commonly used races are available straight from the main page without extra hops.</p> <p>I can't comment on the discussion - I only recently actually created an account for the wikidot website, so I wasn't able to view any history of edits or anything until just a little while back.</p>

Either they haven't checked the page since then, or their browser still had the old version cached, I assume.</p>

						 <p>Table of Contents stuff has been fixed on the main page. My apologies on that, I always forget to update that when I make changes on the main page to the number of headers out there.</p> <p>I'm not sure what data is missing? The Volo's Aasimar is still there <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/lineage:aasimar">Aasimar</a>. Is there some text missing that you're looking for? Both sets of pages existed for quite a while and I think we were pretty thorough with making sure we transferred all the data over. If you can point me to which races are broken or missing I'll definitely take a look.</p> <p>The point of moving them off the main page was to reduce the clutter and it was getting harder and harder to keep the Races organized in that generic list. What if the ToC took you to the main <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/lineage">Lineage</a> page instead of that section of the main page?</p> <p>Another driver of the changes was that the pages themselves had never been included in their own category on the site (ie dnd5e.wikidot.com/aasimar vs. dnd5e.wikidot.com/lineage:aasimar). There are several other sections on the main page that are in the same boat; namely backgrounds and feats. Lineages just ended up being the one tackled because of the category issue as well. I don't know if/when we'll do something to those other two to try and clean them up.</p> <p>There was a discussion on the lineage page changes a while ago when we were planning them, nobody objected at the time. They sat out there for quite a while before we finally pushed them to the main page. Even had a test version of the home page for people to look at.</p>

						 <p>Please? Not only is it vastly more convenient to have the races listed individually and accessibly directly from the main page, instead of having to click and redirect to a 'category' page and then redirect to the race you want, but whoever decided they needed to revamp practically the entire race section back in April (according to history logs) also broke the 'Table of Contents' navigation - the links do not jump to those sections anymore and are off now. They also broke some of the races and some races are missing information (ie. Volo's Aasimar information, etc.)</p> <p>Can we please just fix and revert that?</p>
